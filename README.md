We created this repository while working on project analysing food bank data provided by the Trussell Trust. We (The University of Hull, Coppelia and AAM associates) found we needed some common standards in order to collaborate using so many open data sets. 

This repository contains some tools and data sets we found useful. Unless they are hard to find we haven't provided the open data sets themselves (that would just duplicate what already exists) but rather useful transformations of them and tables that we used to link them together. 

We have also included the code we used to map the geospatial data the SQL to create a mySQL database from the csv files.

## Coding conventions for our data

1. All tables and column names use `lower_case_with_underscores`
2. All file names use `mixedCase`
3. When stored in flat files all dates are formatted as `dd-mm-yyyy`

## Rules for adding new data


## Types of table

1. Hierarchy tables
2. Bridge tables
3.
