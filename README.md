We created this repository while working on project analysing food bank data provided by the Trussell Trust. We (The University of Hull, Coppelia and AAM associates) found we needed some common standards in order to collaborate using so many open data sets. 

This repository contains some tools and data sets we found useful. We haven't provided the open data sets themselves (that would just duplicate what already exists) but rather useful transformations of these data sets and tables that we use to link them together. 

We have also included the code we used to map the geospatial data.
